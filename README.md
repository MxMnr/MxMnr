# Welcome 👋

Although my GitHub account hasn't been all that active in the past, I've been designing and coding technology products, software applications, and websites for 12+ years. I recently decided to move beyond the basic HTML/CSS/JS and AppleScript building I was doing and began the journey of learning Python through Replit's 100 Days of Code program.
