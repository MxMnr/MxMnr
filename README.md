# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I've been designing and building digital technology products, services, and websites for 13+ years. My background lies primarily in user experience and product design, but I've been coding since before I knew what 'UX' was. I recently decided to move beyond the basic HTML/CSS/JS and AppleScript building I was doing, and decided to learn Python through Replit's 100 Days of Code program.
