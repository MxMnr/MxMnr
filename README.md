# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product leader, designer, coder, entrepreneur, and artist. Currently building [SkillsEngine](https://skillsengine.com).

I've been designing and building digital technology products, services, and websites for 15+ years. My background lies primarily in user experience and product design, but I've been coding since before I knew what 'UX' was. Two years ago I decided to move beyond the basic HTML/CSS/JS and AppleScript building I was doing, and learned Python through [Replit's 100 Days of Code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python).

**NOTE:** A significant portion of my coding work is housed in Replit. Inquire for a more complete picture of my code work.
